# BRcoding

This is a collection of small codes (snippets) I wrote.
I love coding and many times I forget codes that I have written before. 
I need to keep these codes so that I can look it up when needed, 
usually simple syntax that I forgot.
Some of the codes are borrowed from various places.

BTW, my goto language when programming is actually Perl :)  but lately I've been coding with Python. Thus, you'll see more Python codes in this space.

Some of the descriptions are in Bahasa Indonesia. In fact, I am going to make it the default.
